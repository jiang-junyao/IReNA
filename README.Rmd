IReNA (Integrated Regulatory Network Analysis) is an R package to perform regulatory network analysis. IReNA contains two methods to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. The first is using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data alone. The second is integrating scRNA-seq data and chromatin accessibility profiles from Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq or bulk ATAC-seq). IReNA performs modular regulatory network to reveal key transcription factors and significant regulatory relationships among modules, providing biological insights on regulatory mechanisms.

## Workflow

![](docs/Readme figure/Workflow1.png){ width=80% height=80% }

## Installation

IReNA needs R version 4.0 or higher, and [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) version 3.12.

First, install Bioconductor, open R platform and run:
```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.12")
```

Next, install several Bioconductor dependencies:
```r
BiocManager::install(c('Rsamtools', 'ChIPseeker', 'monocle',
                       'RcisTarget', 'RCy3', 'clusterProfiler'))
```

Then, install IReNA from GitHub:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jiang-junyao/IReNA")
```

Finally, check whether IReNA was installed correctly, restart R session and run:
```r
library(IReNA)
```
